String::EscapeCage - Cage and escape strings to prevent injection attacks

The String::EscapeCage module puts dangerous strings in a cage.  It eases
escaping to various encodings, helps developers track what data are
dangerous, and prevents injection attacks.


Documentation is maintained (slowly) in POD.  The tarball's files
are based on a mix of modulemaker and modulestarter, but I think I'm
conforming to the Perl and CPAN guidelines.


I welcome constructive criticism and ideas.  Enjoy!

You should be able to to install the module in the usual Perl idiom:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

If you are on a windows box you should use 'nmake' rather than 'make'.
